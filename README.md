[Paper Link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10295013)

This MATLAB code is written by the [PlatEMO](https://github.com/BIMK/PlatEMO) framework.

AC-MMEA proposes a new method in solving ***sparse multi-modal large-scale multi-objective*** optimization problems, which makes it achieve good performance effectively.

This code is from the paper 'Adaptive Merging and Coordinated Offspring Generation in Multi-Population Evolutionary Multi-Modal Multi-Objective Optimization', published in DOCS 2023
